# Code Linting

Linting tools analyze code for potential errors, style violations, and best practices, providing developers with immediate feedback on their commited code. By catching and fixing issues early on, linting helps prevent bugs, improves readability, and promotes maintainability. It also enforces coding standards within a team, making collaboration easier and reducing the likelihood of introducing errors.

Shift-left DevOps refers to the practice of integrating DevOps principles and practices earlier in the software development lifecycle, such as during the planning and design phases, in order to identify and address potential issues and bottlenecks earlier, leading to faster and more efficient software delivery.
