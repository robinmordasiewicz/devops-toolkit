Source Code Management (SCM) plays a vital role in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Quality Assurance (QA), staging, and promotion to production environments. It is the bedrock upon which DevOps principles stand, facilitating streamlined deployment and integration processes. SCM is essential due to its ability to track modifications, collaborative features, and aiding in the prevention of conflicts amongst shared codebases.

As per the adoption trend, GitHub is the leading SCM system worth special mention. However, the choice of an SCM tool can be driven by project requirements. Below are the top four SCMs with their respective links:

- [:octocat: GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [:icon-gitlab: GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [:icon-bitbucket: Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
- [:fa-perforce: Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/)

Embedded at the heart of any Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CICD) DevOps pipeline is the system Git. Git offers a robust, distributed approach expediting frequent commits and updates, thus ensuring code integration into a shared repository without overwriting changes. It underpins quick detection and resolution of conflicts, enhancing the team's ability to collaborate and manage code across various development stages.
