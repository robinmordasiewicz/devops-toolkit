Source Code Management (SCM) plays a vital role in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Quality Assurance (QA), staging, and promotion to production environments. It provides a systematic approach to tracking and managing changes to code, thereby avoiding confusion and ensuring that every change can be audited. In the world of DevOps, SCM is the foundation on which everything else is built.

GitHub is the leading platform for SCM, but it's not the only player in the field. Other widely used SCMs include:

- [:fa-github: GitHub](https://github.com)
- [:fa-gitlab: GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)
- [:fa-bitbucket: Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
- [:fa-perforce: Perforce](https://www.perforce.com)

Git, the underlying version control system used by these SCM platforms, is integral to Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CICD) in a DevOps lifecycle. It allows developers to collaborate on code, automates testing, and delivers updates faster and more reliably.
