Source Code Management (SCM) plays a significant role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), particularly in Quality Assurance (QA), staging, and promotion to production environments. It allows developers to concurrently work on code, provides a history of changes, and it mitigates the risk of software failure, by enabling quick reversion to previous versions in case of failure. SCM has become the bedrock of DevOps as it facilitates in maintaining consistency and traceability in the product development process.

GitHub is the most widely used SCM platforms today. However, several other reliable platforms are worth exploring. Here are the top four widely accepted SCM platforms:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/): :octocat:
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/): :logo-bitbucket:
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/): :gitlab-logo:
- [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/): :subversionlogo:

Git, a distributed SCM tool, forms the backbone of a Continous Integration/Continous Development (CI/CD) DevOps pipeline. Git enables tracking changes in source code during software development and ensures better coordination among developers, enhancing the speed and efficiency of the product development process.
