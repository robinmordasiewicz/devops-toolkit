Source Code Management (SCM) has cemented its place as a pivotal component in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Quality Assurance (QA), Staging, and promotion to production environments. SCM has earned its legitimacy because it aids in tracking and controlling changes in the software, thus making it an integral part of the Foundation of DevOps.

Among the various SCM platforms available, GitHub indisputably stands out as the most widely used one. However, there are other contenders that are just as competent. Here are the top four SCM platforms:

- [:octocat: GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [:bitbucket: Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
- [:gitlab: GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [:aws: AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/)

The backbone of a CI/CD DevOps pipeline is the git version control system. It aids in maintaining a clean and traceable history of code changes, allowing teams to work concurrently without conflict, and supporting processes within the pipeline such as automated builds and deployments. This closes the devops loop, making git an irreplaceable tool in modern development workflows.
