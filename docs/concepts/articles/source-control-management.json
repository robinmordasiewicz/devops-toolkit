The title should be exactly three words. Omit the markdown fence line at the top of the document. Use the metadata without quotes around values. Exclude a summarize section. If using font-awesome icons in links, enclose the icon in a colon character. After the first paragraph, insert the line \"<!-- more -->\". Do not enclose the document with fenced three backticks. Write the technical blog in an instructional style without enclosing the markdown document in fenced backticks to maintain syntactical correctness."
