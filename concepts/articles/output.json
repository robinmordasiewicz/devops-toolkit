SCM has essentially become the foundation of DevOps due to its importance in tracking and controlling changes in the software.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nIn the plethora of SCM platforms, GitHub holds the mantle of the most widely used one. However, several other platforms offer similar functionality, each with its own unique features. Here are the top four SCM platforms:\n\n- [:octocat: GitHub](https://github.com)\n- [:gitlab: GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)\n- [:bitbucket: Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)\n- [:aws: AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit)\n\nGit, a distributed version control system, forms the backbone of Continous Integration and Continous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines within a DevOps environment. It does so by allowing developers to work concurrently, merge their changes, and maintain a complete version history, thereby enabling rapid and efficient software development and deployment."
